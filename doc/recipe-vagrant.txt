Alex Hutton:
Below are the details requested in request R-49973:

[1] Can I have an IP# and DNS entry allocated for the next sequential DEV hostname?
                NOPDEVAPP46 -              10.44.1.118

[2] Can I have a CNAME for the host ‘infobot’?
                Created

[3] The specs will be 2GB memory, 1 vCPU, 30GB disk and it will be created on
the NOPDEVHOST environment. Can you confirm that the resources are available?

The resources are available.  If the VM can do without SAN
storage, then the datastore VMStorage would be the preferred
location for the VM.  If SAN storage is a requirement then the
datastore NOP2_LUN4_SAS is preferred.

[4] I’m thinking of fetching a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS 64 bit image to seed the VM
with, and would like to know where I could stash that temporarily so that
VSphere can load it efficiently. Can you nominate an appropriate location?

There is a folder named ISO Sources located on the VMStorage datastore that can
be used to house the ISO temporarily.
